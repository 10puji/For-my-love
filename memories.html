    <div class="photo"></div>
    <div class="story">It all started from my birthday last year, which is May 10, 2024. She messaged on Instagram to wish me on my birthday, and you wished exactly at 12:00 am (that was so lovely). But, the thing is I have exams and she is trying to extend the conversation but I can’t so I msged her that “Arey naaku exams unnai exams ayipeka msg chestha appudu maatladadhaama” she said okay. So, I messaged her when I was on the train. So, our conversation started, we somehow planned to meet at a night out, and we made our cousins make it happen, so we met there and spoke as cousins. Before that day, she said that she had to tell me something; everyone slept, she and I were still awake, so I went and sat beside her, but we both hesitated to talk with each other so we didn’t spoke that day later on we spoke in insta then she said what she want to I felt bad about her and tried to help her get back to normal thereafter, we started talking everyday and everyhour. one day I went on a family trip to dharmapalli waterfalls then after coming home I checked instagram. I have more than 10 messages that “chinodaaaaaaaaaaaa enti ra intha allavatu ayipoyav, maatladochu kadha naatho” that is when I fell for her for the first time because no one gave me this attention in my life. When I turn back and look, I have zero friends; no one has stayed with me for a long time, and I have a habit of leaving those who don't care about me. I don’t beg for attention. There she came, she misses me every minute and every second, this is what I expected from my wife. Then again, this happened. She once went for a family meet, and before going there, she used to send her fitness checks, then it itself (when we are not even in a relationship), see how much she trusts me. And she even used to intimate before going anywhere (I fell more for her). And from there on, I started missing her very badly. I didn’t pay much attention to any girl in my life. Finally, we thought of meeting in pages on the 23rd of June(I guess), exactly on 21st June, which is a special day not only for us, because it is the longest day of the year. That day our conversation was going on WhatsApp, and suddenly we had nothing to talk and a couple of days ago we told our sisters that we both might get into a relationship, and we’re in confusion, and I even made a wish to <b>Venkateswara Swamy</b> to clarify this and show me the path towards this relationship he helped me. And then in the middle of the convo she msged me “bore kodathundhi” at 4:10PM  and then where I proposed her at 4:12PM <br> <b>like this:</b></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
